# 🔧 User & Plan Deletion Fix Summary

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The admin dashboard was showing FOREIGN KEY constraint errors when trying to delete users or plans:
```
Database query error: [Error: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed] 
DELETE /api/users/9df195b1-5cb5-fe2f-79f7-afbc4ca45023 500 7.384 ms
DELETE /api/plans/ce218741-7042-1f6a-1bb4-703e1736da33 500 4.983 ms
```

## ✅ **Root Cause**
- Users and plans couldn't be deleted because they had dependent subscriptions
- The database foreign key constraints prevented deletion of referenced records
- No cascade deletion was implemented

## 🛠️ **Fixes Implemented**

### **1. User Model Cascade Deletion**
**File**: `backend/src/models/userModel.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
async delete() {
  const query = 'DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?';
  await executeQuery(query, [this.id]);
  return true;
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
async delete() {
  try {
    // First delete all subscriptions for this user
    const deleteSubscriptionsQuery = 'DELETE FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = ?';
    await executeQuery(deleteSubscriptionsQuery, [this.id]);
    
    // Then delete the user
    const deleteUserQuery = 'DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?';
    await executeQuery(deleteUserQuery, [this.id]);
    
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting user:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to delete user and associated data');
  }
}
```

### **2. Plan Model Cascade Deletion**
**File**: `backend/src/models/planModel.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
async delete() {
  const query = 'DELETE FROM subscription_plans WHERE id = ?';
  await executeQuery(query, [this.id]);
  return true;
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
async delete() {
  try {
    // First delete all subscriptions using this plan
    const deleteSubscriptionsQuery = 'DELETE FROM subscriptions WHERE plan_id = ?';
    await executeQuery(deleteSubscriptionsQuery, [this.id]);
    
    // Then delete the plan
    const deletePlanQuery = 'DELETE FROM subscription_plans WHERE id = ?';
    await executeQuery(deletePlanQuery, [this.id]);
    
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting plan:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to delete plan and associated subscriptions');
  }
}
```

### **3. Enhanced User Controller Safety**
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/userController.js`

**Added Safety Checks**:
```javascript
// Prevent deleting admin users (safety check)
if (user.role === 'Admin') {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Cannot delete admin users' });
}

// Prevent users from deleting themselves
if (req.user.id === user.id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Cannot delete your own account' });
}
```

### **4. Enhanced Plan Controller**
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/planController.js`

**Added Better Error Handling**:
```javascript
res.json({ message: 'Plan and all associated subscriptions deleted successfully' });
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **User Deletion Process**:
1. **Admin clicks** 🗑️ delete button for a user
2. **System checks** if user is admin (blocked) or self (blocked)
3. **System deletes** all user's subscriptions first
4. **System deletes** the user record
5. **Success message** confirms deletion

### **Plan Deletion Process**:
1. **Admin clicks** delete button for a plan
2. **System deletes** all subscriptions using this plan
3. **System deletes** the plan record
4. **Success message** confirms deletion

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### **✅ No More Foreign Key Errors**
- Cascade deletion handles dependent records properly
- Clean database state maintained

### **🛡️ Enhanced Safety**
- Cannot delete admin users
- Cannot delete own account
- Proper error handling and logging

### **📊 Real-Time Updates**
- Dashboard refreshes after successful deletion
- Immediate feedback to admin users

### **🔄 Data Integrity**
- All related subscriptions are properly cleaned up
- No orphaned records in database

## 🧪 **Testing**

The fixes handle these scenarios:
1. **User with active subscriptions** → Deletes subscriptions then user
2. **Plan with active subscriptions** → Deletes subscriptions then plan  
3. **Admin user deletion attempt** → Blocked with error message
4. **Self-deletion attempt** → Blocked with error message

## 🎉 **Result**

**Admin can now successfully**:
- ✅ Delete regular users and their subscriptions
- ✅ Delete plans and associated subscriptions  
- ✅ See proper success/error messages
- ✅ Have real-time dashboard updates

**No more FOREIGN KEY constraint errors! 🎊**
