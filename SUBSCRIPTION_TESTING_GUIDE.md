# Subscription Testing Guide

## 🔍 **Current Issue Analysis**

The TypeScript errors have been fixed, but you mentioned you can't see your current subscriptions. This is likely because:

1. **Admin Account Has No Subscriptions**: The admin account (`admin@subscription.com`) is not seeded with subscriptions - only regular users have them.

2. **Need to Test with End User Account**: The seeded subscriptions are assigned to end user accounts, not admin accounts.

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test with End User Account**

**Login with a user that has subscriptions:**
- **Email**: `john.doe@email.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

**Expected subscriptions for john.doe@email.com:**
- Premium Fibernet plan ($49.99/month)
- Status: Active
- Data quota and usage tracking

### **Step 2: Test with Other Users**

**Other users with subscriptions:**
- `jane.smith@email.com` / `password123` → Basic Fibernet (Active)
- `michael.johnson@email.com` / `password123` → Enterprise Fibernet (Active)
- `david.brown@email.com` / `password123` → Premium Fibernet (Active)
- `emily.davis@email.com` / `password123` → Basic Fibernet (Active)

### **Step 3: Verify Admin Account**

**Admin account (`admin@subscription.com`) should:**
- ✅ Have access to AdminDashboard
- ✅ See all users and their subscriptions
- ❌ Have no personal subscriptions (this is normal)

## 🔧 **How to Test**

### **1. Start the System:**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend
cd frontend/project
npm run dev
```

### **2. Test End User Experience:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/auth`
2. Login with: `john.doe@email.com` / `password123`
3. Check UserDashboard - should show subscription statistics
4. Go to `/subscriptions` - should show detailed subscription list
5. Go to `/profile` - should show billing information

### **3. Test Admin Experience:**
1. Logout and login with: `admin@subscription.com` / `admin123`
2. Should redirect to AdminDashboard
3. Should see all users and their subscriptions
4. Personal subscription pages will be empty (normal for admin)

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **For End Users (john.doe@email.com):**
- **UserDashboard**: Shows 1 active subscription, monthly cost $49.99
- **SubscriptionsPage**: Shows Premium Fibernet plan details
- **ProfilePage**: Shows billing information with $49.99/month

### **For Admin (admin@subscription.com):**
- **AdminDashboard**: Shows all users and system statistics
- **Personal subscriptions**: Empty (admin accounts don't have subscriptions)

## 🐛 **If Still No Subscriptions Showing**

### **Check Backend Data:**
Run this test to verify backend has subscription data:
```bash
node test_subscription_data.js
```

### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for any errors
3. Check Network tab to see if API calls are successful

### **Verify Database:**
```bash
cd backend
# Check if database exists and has data
ls -la *.db
```

### **Re-seed Database if Needed:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run setup  # This will recreate and seed the database
```

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

### **End User Account Should Show:**
- Active subscription count > 0
- Monthly spending > $0
- Subscription details with plan name, price, usage
- Data usage progress bars
- Real billing dates

### **Admin Account Should Show:**
- Total users, plans, subscriptions in AdminDashboard
- Empty personal subscription pages (normal)
- Access to all system management features

## 🎯 **Key Points**

1. **Admin accounts don't have personal subscriptions** - this is by design
2. **End user accounts have the subscription data** - test with john.doe@email.com
3. **All data is real from backend** - no more dummy data
4. **If no subscriptions show for end users** - database may need re-seeding

**Try logging in with `john.doe@email.com` / `password123` to see the subscription data! 🚀**
